# F1-Essay-Code
This repository contains the code I have written in order to write my math paper on Formula 1. The paper is in this repository as well.

Although the code and the essay was written in high school, the version of the code you will see here has been written in the summer of 2021 after my freshman year of college. The code has been improved by increasing readability, as well as by implementing more interesting coding techniques, such as threading.

Throughout my code, I use the following libraries:
- os
- requests
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- threading
- asyncio
- aiohttp

If you have any suggestions on how I can improve this code, feel free to open an issue on GitHub. I would love to hear your insight!
