# F1-Essay-Code
This repository contains the code I have written in order to write my math paper on Formula 1. The paper is in this repository as well.

Most of this code was written when I was in high school. Some files, however, I wrote recently, because I wanted to incorporate cool stuff like threading into my code. 

Throughout my code, I use the following libraries:
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- Scipy
